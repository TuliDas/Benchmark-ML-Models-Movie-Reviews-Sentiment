# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis ðŸŽ¬

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews (positive vs. negative). The workflow follows a structured and modular pipeline for preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, selection, and error analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and label binarization.  
   - Convert raw reviews into usable text format.

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Bag-of-Words (BoW)  
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Models: Logistic Regression, MultinomialNB, SGDClassifier, LinearSVC  
   - Configurations: Baseline & Tuned  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

4. **Best Model Selection**  
   - Identify the **best baseline** and **best tuned model** based on **F1-Score**.

5. **Error Analysis**  
   - Compute **False Positives (FP)** and **False Negatives (FN)** for both models.  
   - Compare misclassifications between baseline and tuned models.  
   - Generate detailed `.txt` files for FP & FN instances:
     - Detected by both models
     - Detected by baseline only
     - Detected by tuned only  

6. **Visualization**  
   - Confusion matrices  
   - Barplots for model performance comparisons
